Hehe alright dumbo 💙 — I’ll hold your hand through the entire process, from zero → working test, no app needed. I’ll give exact console clicks, commands, and a ready-to-run Python test script. I’ll also explain what to watch for and what your lead will expect in the demo. I won’t skip anything. Ready? Let’s go.


---

Overview (what we’ll build & test)

You’ll create (or reuse) an RDS database → create a Secrets Manager secret for DB credentials → create an RDS Proxy that uses that secret → run a small Python script from an EC2 (or local) client to simulate many concurrent connections and compare behavior (direct DB vs proxy) → optionally trigger a failover and observe how the proxy handles it.

Important facts (from AWS docs):

RDS Proxy must be in the same VPC as the DB and the proxy itself is not publicly accessible. 

Database credentials for RDS Proxy are stored/referenced via AWS Secrets Manager (we’ll create that secret). 

RDS Proxy needs proper network planning (subnets with free IPs across AZs). For bigger DB instance sizes you must reserve more IP addresses. Don’t skip this. 

You can create a proxy via the Console, CLI or API; I’ll show Console steps + CLI examples. 

To force a failover for testing you can use Reboot → “Reboot with failover” in the RDS console or use the CLI/boto3 reboot_db_instance --force-failover. 



---

Prerequisites (what you need)

1. AWS account + IAM user with privileges: RDS, Secrets Manager, IAM, EC2, CloudWatch.


2. A DB engine (I’ll use MySQL examples). If you don’t have one, I’ll show how to create a small test RDS instance below.


3. Terminal / ability to SSH to an EC2 instance in the same VPC (preferred) or permission to temporarily open security group to your local IP (less secure).


4. Python 3 installed on test machine, plus pymysql package (I’ll show install).




---

Step-by-step: create a small test environment (full console clicks)

A — (Optional) Create a test RDS MySQL instance

If you already have an RDS instance skip to step B.

Console steps:

1. Go to AWS Console → RDS → Databases → Create database.


2. Engine: MySQL (choose version that matches your environment).


3. Template: Free tier (if available) or Dev/Test.


4. DB instance identifier: rds-test-db (or pick name).


5. Credentials: set Master username (e.g., admin) and a strong password (you’ll store this in Secrets Manager).


6. Connectivity: choose the VPC you use (default VPC is fine for testing). Set Public access = No (recommended).

If you want to test from local machine without EC2, you could set Public access = Yes and add your IP to the DB SG (only for quick testing — not recommended in prod).



7. Choose Multi-AZ = No for a low-cost test; if you want failover testing, create Multi-AZ = Yes (or use a Multi-AZ-ready instance). Note: failover options differ for single vs Multi-AZ — be mindful.


8. Leave other values default; Create DB.


9. Wait until Status = available (5–15 min depending on instance).



> Security groups: create or note the DB security group. For secure testing, we’ll create an EC2 in same VPC and allow its security group to talk to DB’s security group on port 3306.




---

B — Create a Secrets Manager secret (RDS creds)

(You need this secret for the proxy to use DB credentials.)

Console steps:

1. AWS Console → Secrets Manager → Store a new secret.


2. Choose Credentials for Amazon RDS database.


3. Enter Username = admin (or whatever you set), Password = your DB password.


4. Under Secret key/value, leave default (Secrets Manager will construct the JSON).


5. Under Select the encryption key, default is fine unless you use custom KMS.


6. For Secret name, enter rds/test-db-secret (or my-rds-proxy-secret).


7. Finish creating the secret (Next → Next → Store).


8. Note the Secret ARN (you’ll need it when creating the proxy). 




---

C — (Optional) IAM role for RDS Proxy

You can let RDS auto-create the needed IAM role when creating the proxy. If you want to create a custom IAM role, create a role that allows secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on the secret and has a trust policy that allows the rds.amazonaws.com service to assume it. (AWS can create this role for you during proxy creation.) 


---

D — Create the RDS Proxy (Console — exact clicks)

1. AWS Console → RDS → Proxies → Create proxy. 


2. Proxy identifier: rds-test-proxy.


3. Engine family: choose MySQL (or MySQL-compatible Aurora).


4. For authentication: choose the Secrets Manager secret you created (rds/test-db-secret).

Option: enable IAM authentication if you want passwordless IAM-based client auth (extra setup).



5. Connectivity: select the same VPC as your DB and choose subnets in at least two AZs (default picks work).


6. Proxy target role: choose Read/write target group (default).


7. Idle client timeout: default 1800s is fine for test. (Lower if you want shorter pooling).


8. Require TLS: recommended for production. (If using IAM auth, TLS may be required).


9. For IAM role: either let AWS create the role for you (recommended) or choose the custom one you made.


10. Create proxy — wait a few minutes until proxy status is Available.



Register DB targets: On the proxy's details page, add the RDS instance (target) either during creation or using Register targets → select your DB instance / cluster to add it to the proxy’s target group. 

(You can also create proxy via CLI: aws rds create-db-proxy --db-proxy-name my-proxy --engine-family MYSQL --auth ... --role-arn ... --vpc-subnet-ids ... --vpc-security-group-ids ...)


---

E — Networking checklist (very important)

Proxy and DB must be in same VPC. You cannot reach the proxy from outside the VPC unless you setup special networking. 

Proxy uses ENIs in your subnets — make sure subnets have free IP capacity (see doc for minimum free IP numbers). If your subnets are crowded, proxy creation/scale will fail. 

Security groups:

Create SG for EC2 test machine (allow SSH from your IP).

For proxy SG: allow inbound DB port (3306) from the EC2 SG (not 0.0.0.0/0).

For DB SG: allow inbound from the proxy SG (not the EC2 SG directly if you want to force traffic via proxy).


Preferred test path: EC2 (same VPC) → RDS Proxy endpoint → RDS. This avoids making DB or Proxy public.



---

Test setup: spinning up an EC2 for testing (quick)

If you’ll run from local machine and you made DB public, skip this. Otherwise:

Console steps:

1. AWS Console → EC2 → Launch Instance.


2. Choose Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu, t2.micro (free tier) for quick tests.


3. Network: choose same VPC and subnet as the proxy (or a subnet that can reach proxy); attach the EC2 SG you made.


4. Launch and SSH in.



From EC2, install Python + pymysql:

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y python3
python3 -m pip install --user pymysql
# or on Ubuntu
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip
# pip3 install --user pymysql


---

The Python test script (copy-paste & run)

This script simulates N concurrent clients. One run connects to direct DB endpoint, another run uses proxy endpoint. Compare failures, average connect time, and connection count behavior.

Create file rds_proxy_test.py on the EC2 (or local) and paste:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
rds_proxy_test.py
Usage:
  python3 rds_proxy_test.py --host <endpoint> --user <user> --password <pwd> --db <dbname> --port 3306 --connections 100 --hold 5

This script opens many concurrent connections to the given host (DB or Proxy),
runs a short query and optionally holds the connection for `--hold` seconds
before closing, to simulate many simultaneous open connections (connection pooling test).

    run_test(args.host, args.user, args.password, args.db, args.port, args.connections, args.hold, args.workers)

How to run:

1. Save file, make executable: chmod +x rds_proxy_test.py.


2. Run direct DB test:



python3 rds_proxy_test.py --host <your-db-endpoint> --user admin --password '<pwd>' --db <dbname> --connections 100 --hold 3

3. Run proxy test:



python3 rds_proxy_test.py --host <your-proxy-endpoint> --user admin --password '<pwd>' --db <dbname> --connections 100 --hold 3

What you’ll observe

Direct DB: many connections may cause errors like “Too many connections” or high latency.

Proxy: many client connections will be served with fewer DB connections (the proxy reuses DB conns), so fewer DB errors and smoother success rates. This is the pooling effect.



---

Failover test (safe way to show proxy advantage)

1. Start a long-running run against both (open two terminals): one running the script against direct DB and one against proxy. Use --hold 30 so connections stay open.


2. In AWS Console: RDS → Databases → select your DB → Actions → Reboot. Tick Reboot with failover? (forces failover). Click Reboot. 


3. Watch both client terminals:

Direct DB connections: likely see connection errors / downtime until the DB failover completes.

Proxy client: proxy will automatically route to standby target and preserve application connections or reconnect faster — fewer errors on your script. (This is the "resiliency" advantage.)




Also watch RDS events and CloudWatch for metrics during this test.


---

How to measure & show results to your lead

1. CloudWatch (Per-Proxy metrics): open CloudWatch → Metrics → RDS → Per-Proxy Metrics and inspect ClientConnections, DatabaseConnections, and request/latency metrics while tests are running. (Useful to show how client connections spiked but DB connections stayed controlled by proxy.) 


2. Script output: capture the successes/failures/avg_connect_time numbers for direct DB vs proxy and compare.


3. Failover observation: record approximate downtime (seconds) observed on direct vs proxy. (Proxy usually recovers faster for apps because it hides DB reconnections.) 




---

Cleanup (very important to avoid charges)

Delete the RDS Proxy, the Secrets Manager secret (or set to disable secret rotation), and the test RDS instance (or snapshot + stop).

Terminate the EC2 test instance.
Do this immediately after your demo to avoid extra costs.



---

Short checklist you can read in Scrum (exact wording)

Today:

> “I studied Amazon RDS Proxy — how it fits between app and DB, how it handles connection pooling, secure credential storage via Secrets Manager, and failover behavior. I created a test plan and prepared the environment to run hands-on tests (Secrets Manager secret + proxy).”



Tomorrow:

> “I will run hands-on tests: simulate 100+ concurrent connections using a Python script, compare direct DB vs proxy behavior, and perform a failover test to report the difference in error rates and recovery time. I’ll collect CloudWatch metrics and prepare a short findings summary.”



(If they ask for hours: say ~4 hours to test + gather screenshots and metrics.)


---

Quick troubleshooting tips (if things break)

Proxy status stuck? Check that subnets have enough free IPs in each AZ. 

“Access denied” to secret? Ensure the proxy’s IAM role can read secretsmanager:GetSecretValue for your secret OR let AWS auto-create the role. 

Connection timeouts from local machine? Make sure EC2/test machine is in same VPC or you opened DB/proxy SG to your IP (temporary). 



---

If you want, I can:

Make a one-page test report template (screenshots placeholders + metrics) you can hand to your lead.

Convert the Python test script to Postgres (psycopg2) if your DB is Postgres instead of MySQL.

Give the exact AWS CLI / boto3 commands to create proxy, register targets, and force a failover.


Which one should I do now? (I’ll just pick one if you don’t say — but tell me if you prefer Postgres or MySQL.)
